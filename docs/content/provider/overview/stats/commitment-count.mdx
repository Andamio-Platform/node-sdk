# Commitment Count

These functions retrieve commitment statistics associated with a set of policies or an alias from the local state of an instance on the blockchain.

---

## `commitmentCount(core, policies)`

Counts the number of committed UTXOs per policy.

### **Signature**
```ts
export async function commitmentCount(core: Core, policies: string[]): Promise<{
  policy: string;
  state: string;
  committed: number;
}[]>
```

### **Parameters**

| Name     | Type     | Description                              |
|----------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| core     | `Core`   | Core SDK object                          |
| policies | `string[]` | Array of policy IDs to check against     |

### **Returns**

A promise that resolves to an array of objects, each containing:

- `policy`: The policy ID
- `state`: `"Project"` or `"Course"` (mapped from internal `Escrow1` or `AssignmentValidator`)
- `committed`: Number of UTXOs found under the respective policy

### **Behavior**

1. Retrieves all UTXOs from instance local states.
2. Filters only UTXOs from addresses with state `Escrow1` or `AssignmentValidator`.
3. For each address, fetches its UTXOs and aggregates commitment counts by policy.
4. Converts internal state to high-level label:
   - `Escrow1` → `Project`
   - `AssignmentValidator` → `Course`

### **Errors**

- Returns an empty array and logs to console in case of an error.

## `commitmentCountUnderAlias(core, alias)`

Wrapper around `commitmentCount` that resolves policies from an alias before counting commitments.

### **Signature**
```ts
export async function commitmentCountUnderAlias(core: Core, alias: string): Promise<{
  policy: string;
  state: string;
  committed: number;
}[]>
```

### **Parameters**

| Name  | Type     | Description                |
|-------|----------|----------------------------|
| core  | `Core`   | Core SDK instance          |
| alias | `string` | Alias to lookup policies   |

### **Returns**

Same structure as `commitmentCount`.

### **Behavior**

1. Retrieves governance UTXOs from local state.
2. Resolves the alias to associated policy IDs.
3. Uses `commitmentCount` to get counts per policy.

## Example

```ts
const policies = ["policy1", "policy2"];
const results = await commitmentCount(core, policies);

const aliasResults = await commitmentCountUnderAlias(core, "blockchain-course");
```

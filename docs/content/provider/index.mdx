# Andamio Provider

The Provider is a core component of the Andamio SDK designed to retrieve and interact with on-chain Andamio-specific data. It serves as the connection layer between your application and the Andamio blockchain data structures.

```typescript
const sdk = new AndamioSDK("https://preprod.utxorpc-v0.demeter.run:443", "Preprod", "dmtr_utxorpc...")

const provider = sdk.provider
```

## Overview

The Provider component abstracts the complexity of querying and processing blockchain data specific to Andamio protocols and smart contracts. It offers a streamlined interface for developers to access this data without having to manage the underlying blockchain interactions directly.

## Key Features

- Access to Andamio-specific on-chain data structures
- Simplified query methods for common Andamio data patterns
- Consistent interface for blockchain interactions
- Optimized data retrieval for Andamio protocols
